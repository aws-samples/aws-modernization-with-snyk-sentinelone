# Introduction

## Learning Objectives <!-- MODIFY THIS SUBHEADING -->

This paragraph block should highlight the learning objectives of the workshop. A bulleted list works well for this purpose.

## Workshop Structure <!-- MODIFY THIS SUBHEADING -->
This paragraph block should be utilized to briefly explain the submodules that are going to be presented as well as the approximate total time for the workshop and individual submodules. 


For example:


*  Prerequisites *(15 minutes)* 
*  Setting up an account for the solution *(15 minutes)* 
*  Module 1: Module 1 Title *(30 minutes)* 
*  Module 2: Module 2 Title *(30 minutes)* 
*  Module 3: Module 3 Title *(30 minutes)* 


**REMOVE:** With the exception of _index.md, the module folders and filenames should be changed to better reflect their content, i.e. 1_Planning as the folder and 11_HowToBegin as the first submodule. Changing the "weight" value of the header is ultimately what reflects the order the modules are presented.



**REMOVE:** Every introduction page should include the following warning label.


The examples and sample code provided in this workshop are intended to be consumed as instructional content. These will help you understand how various AWS services can be architected to build a solution while demonstrating best practices along the way. These examples are not intended for use in production environments.


### Next Section Heading <!-- MODIFY THIS HEADING -->
This paragraph block can optionally be utilized to lead into the next section of the workshop.
